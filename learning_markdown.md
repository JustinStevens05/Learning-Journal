# What is markdown
Markdown is a computer language that is easy to read and can be used to create things like websites.

## What is the syntax
Syntax is what needs to be written for the code to be able to funtion. The syntax of markdown is simple
and easy for humans to read.

### Some examples of the syntax are
* using #,##, and ### to get different sized headers
* using two asteriks on both sides of a word to make it **bold**
* using and underscore on both sides of a word to make it _italic_

### You can also make lists in markdown
these lists can be made in multiple ways such as
1. using numbers like 1. 2. and 3. to make a numbered list
2. using astricks to make bullet points

### links can also be added
