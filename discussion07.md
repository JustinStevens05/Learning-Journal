# Today I learned more about Javascript
today in javascript I learned about operators and functions

## functions
functions are bits of code that can be refered to by calling them through a defined name. now why do people use them? well there is multiple reasons

- code can be reused
- can help shorten code by not having things repeat

## operators
operators are are things that can be done to variable like math here are some examples

- (+) can be used to add two numbers or put two strings together
- (-) can be used to subtract to numbers
- (*) can be used to multiply two numbers
- ( / ) can be used to divide two numbers
- ( = ) is used to set something as equal to something else
- ( == ) is used to check and see if two things are equal
- ( != ) is used to check and see if two things are not equal
- ( += ) is used to add two numbers together and make a variable equal the answer
- ( -= ) is used to subtract two numbers together and make a variable equal the answer
- ( <,> ) these are used to test and see if one thing is greter then or less then another
- ( % ) is used to divide a number by another and give a variable what the remander will be
