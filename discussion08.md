# today I learned about even more about javascript
today I learned about loops and and reviewed some information on operators as well as learned a few new operators

### Here are some I learned about
- ( === ) this is used to check if something is of equal value and the same type
- ( !== ) this is used to check if something is not or equal value or type
- there are also some vaiables like typeof that return what the type of the variable is

## loops
loops come in a few different forms

- while loops
- for loops
- do while loops

loops can be used to repeat code a certain number of times like in the case of for loops or indefinatly until something happens like in while loops

### While loops
While loops repeat while a certain condition is true this is the same as do while loops
and can look like something saying continue to ask this question until the answer isn't three

### For loops
for loops repeat a certain section of code a set number of times
this can look like someone saying ask them for a number three times
