# What I learned today
Today I learned about Git. Git is a version control this means that it saves changes and the files can be reverted back to their old forms

### There are three types of verison control
- Local version control
- Centralized version control 
- disributed version control

## Local version conrtol
local version control is where a single hard drive stores all the files

## Centralized version control
centralized version control is a single server is in charge of holding all the files. This allows multiple people to work on something at the same time

## Distributed version control
distributed version control allows for multiple mirror files to made of a repository which allows for much safer storing
