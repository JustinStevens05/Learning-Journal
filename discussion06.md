Today I learned about some of the different aspects of javascript as well as how a computer works

## Javascript
Today I learned about variables. to create a variable you need to put the word var infront of a keyword that will be used to call the vaiable 
variables can beanything from numbers to words and even other variables to make a variable it looks like this var myVariable = 24; now if a call the variable myVariable it will send 24

- input
- store
- process
- output

a computer has to do all these things. a computer works by processesing things at an incredibly fat speed and then giving what is has processed to the user through an output system
